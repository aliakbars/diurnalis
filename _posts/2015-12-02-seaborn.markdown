Have you ever dealt with [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and got frustrated with it? If you have done plotting in Matlab or R, I am very certain that you loathe matplotlib, just as I do. Although it has a vast amount of features, it is just quite troublesome to get used to it. The drawing itself is not the eye-catching one. However, that was the past.

Meet [**seaborn**](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/). This Stanford-made library is an exquisite way to visualize statistical data. It *is* based on matplotlib, but in combination with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), the well-known data analysis library. They have clearly put smiles on Python-lovers/data-scientists' faces again.

Here is a snippet for simple point plot:

{% highlight python %}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.DataFrame({'x': np.arange(10), 'y': np.random.rand(10)})
ax = sns.pointplot(x='x', y='y', data=df)
plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

which will result in something like this:

Pretty neat, isn't it? And, oh, *yes*, you need numpy to use seaborn.

The developers even included some sample dataset, e.g. the Anscombe's quartet, cortial brain networks, and car crashes. Of course you can use your own dataset. The library is very csv-friendly, though this is because of pandas.

Another nice feature you can get from seaborn is that you can draw marginal distributions from the dataset with just a single line of code! The snippet below will show you how it is done.

{% highlight python %}
import seaborn as sns
sns.set(style="darkgrid", color_codes=True)

tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
g = sns.jointplot("total_bill", "tip", data=tips, kind="reg",
                  xlim=(0, 60), ylim=(0, 12), color="r", size=7)
{% endhighlight %}

The code will result in something like the figure below.
