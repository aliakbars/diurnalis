> On another day, 6 readings on span gas turn out to be 72, 79, 65, 84, 67, 77. Is the machine properly calibrated? Or do the measurements show bias?

*This problem and its solution are taken from Statistics by Freedman, et al. (1998).*

Important things to note:

1. \\(N = 6 \rightarrow df = 5\\),
2. \\(\mathbb{E}[x] = 70\\) (given in the previous problem)
3. \\(\bar{x} = 74\\)
4. \\(SD_{\bar{x}} = 6.68\\)
5. \\(SD^{+} = \sqrt{\frac{N}{N-1}} \times SD_{\bar{x}} = \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} \times 6.68 \approx 7.32\\)
5. \\(SE = \frac{SD^{+}}{\sqrt{N}} = \frac{7.32}{6} \approx 2.99\\)

Therefore, we can calculate the \\(t\\)-statistics as follows:

$$
t = \frac{\bar{x}-\mathbb{E}[x]}{SE}
= \frac{74 - 70}{2.99}
\approx 1.34 
$$

Using the routine from `scipy`, we got

{% highlight python %}
>>> from scipy.stats import t
>>> 1 - t.cdf(1.34, df=5)
0.11895750620122192
{% endhighlight %}
