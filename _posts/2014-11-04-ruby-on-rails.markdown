I am trying to learn [Ruby on Rails][ror] now. It seems like creating web apps can be effortless when you use Ruby on Rails -- even for the Javascript and CSS parts! Learning Ruby on Rails means you will learn one type of syntax to rule them all.

Ruby on Rails uses [Coffeescript][coffee] to build Javascript files and [Sass][sass] to build CSS files. By eliminating curly brackets and semi-colon, your code will be more human-readable. They even compile it down to a pretty-printed Javascript and CSS! It is simply awesome.

Being one of the best web-app development framework, they use Ruby on Rails as a guideline to create Laravel or so I've heard. However, I still hesitate to use Ruby on Rails on a daily basis. I am afraid that it will make me faltered when I have to face "raw" Javascript and CSS. I mean, I hate Java now since I've learned how to use Python.

What do you think?
